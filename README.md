# Giphy-App

This program will generate 10 gifs of whatever topic of the user's choice. In this program we use the gify API to pull based on the value of the imput the user types in the box. After this I used a for loop to build a grid of gifs by creating new divs and on top of those divs new lines to label each gif. We then also dig into the api response to pull a still of the gif AND the gif its self. Then the progam checks the state of each div that we previously generated and if it is clicked then it with change the data-state from still to animated and vice versa.
